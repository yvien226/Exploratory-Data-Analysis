# Feature Diagnostics Notebook
This notebook is intended to examine the data quality of individual features,  facilitating the assessment of their correlation with the target feature and identifying whether any specific feature necessitates further refinement. 

The notebook is generalised and can be used to any dataset with date.


[Telco Churn dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) is used as an example. Please see `output_sample/` for sample output result.
